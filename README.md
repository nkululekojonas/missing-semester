# Missing Semester - Exercise Repository

Welcome to my repository for the "Missing Semester" course offered by MIT. This repository is dedicated to storing and organizing all the code and solutions for the exercises completed throughout the course.

## Overview

The "Missing Semester" course provides essential skills in software engineering, systems administration, and productivity that are often missing from traditional academic curricula. This repository will house my solutions and practice code for the exercises in the course, covering topics such as:

- Command-line tools and shell scripting
- Version control with Git
- Text processing and data manipulation
- Debugging and system administration
- Productivity tools and techniques

## Repository Structure

- **`exercises/`**: Contains directories and files for each exercise or topic covered in the course. Each directory includes the code, solutions, and any relevant notes for that specific exercise.
- **`notes/`**: Optional section for personal notes and insights gained during the course. This can help with quick reference and review.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/missing-semester-exercises.git
